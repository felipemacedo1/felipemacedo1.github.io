# ADR-001: Security & Performance Foundation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Terminal Portfolio application needs to be upgraded to enterprise-grade standards with focus on security, performance, and maintainability. The current implementation lacks proper security controls, performance monitoring, and enterprise-level architecture patterns.

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive security and performance foundation consisting of:

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Manager
- **Implementation**: `src/js/security/CSPManager.js`
- **Features**: 
  - Cryptographic nonce generation using `crypto.getRandomValues()`
  - Dynamic CSP injection via meta tags
  - Violation reporting and monitoring
- **Rationale**: Prevents XSS attacks and provides defense-in-depth security

### 2. Enterprise Rate Limiter
- **Implementation**: `src/js/core/RateLimiter.js`
- **Algorithm**: Sliding window + token bucket hybrid
- **Features**:
  - In-memory storage using Map for performance
  - Per-client tracking and metrics
  - Configurable limits and token refill rates
- **Rationale**: Prevents abuse and ensures system stability under load

### 3. Service Worker with Cache Strategies
- **Implementation**: `sw.js`
- **Strategies**:
  - Stale-while-revalidate for static assets
  - Network-first with fallback for API calls
  - Background Sync for queued actions
- **Rationale**: Improves performance and enables offline functionality

### 4. Performance Monitor
- **Implementation**: `src/js/core/PerformanceMonitor.js`
- **Metrics**: Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS), custom terminal metrics
- **Features**:
  - PerformanceObserver integration
  - Real-time monitoring and alerting
  - Memory and frame rate tracking
- **Rationale**: Enables data-driven performance optimization

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Security**: Comprehensive protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Real-time monitoring and optimization capabilities
- **Reliability**: Rate limiting prevents system overload
- **Offline Support**: Service worker enables offline functionality
- **Monitoring**: Detailed metrics for performance analysis

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Increased codebase complexity
- **Bundle Size**: Additional ~15KB (within 250KB limit)
- **Browser Support**: Some features require modern browsers

## Implementation Details

### Bundle Size Impact
- CSPManager: ~2KB
- RateLimiter: ~3KB
- Service Worker: ~4KB
- PerformanceMonitor: ~6KB
- **Total**: ~15KB (6% of 250KB limit)

### Performance Benchmarks
- CSP nonce generation: <1ms
- Rate limit check: <0.1ms
- Performance metric collection: <0.5ms

### Security Measures
- All user input sanitized
- CSP prevents inline script execution
- Rate limiting prevents DoS attacks
- Service worker validates all cached resources

## Alternatives Considered

1. **External Security Libraries**: Rejected due to bundle size constraints
2. **Server-side Rate Limiting**: Not applicable for static site deployment
3. **Third-party Performance Tools**: Rejected to maintain zero dependencies

## Monitoring and Success Criteria

### Security Metrics
- Zero CSP violations in production
- Rate limiting effectiveness >99%
- No XSS vulnerabilities detected

### Performance Metrics
- Lighthouse score â‰¥95
- Core Web Vitals within thresholds:
  - LCP <2.5s
  - FID <100ms
  - CLS <0.1

### Reliability Metrics
- Service worker cache hit rate >80%
- Background sync success rate >95%

## Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 2: Architecture Modernization
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Performance optimization based on monitoring data
4. Security audit and penetration testing
